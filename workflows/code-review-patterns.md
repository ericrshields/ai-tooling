# AI Code Review Patterns

Hub for comprehensive patterns on automated code review using LLMs and AI agents based on 2026 industry research.

---

## Overview

AI-powered code review has matured significantly by 2026. Modern approaches combine prompt engineering, multi-dimensional parallel analysis, and self-healing workflows to achieve both speed and comprehensiveness.

**Key Principle**: AI should be treated as a powerful pair programmer that requires clear direction, context, and oversight rather than autonomous judgment.

**Architecture**: Run specialized review agents in parallel (5-6x faster), each focused on a specific dimension (security, performance, maintainability, etc.), then synthesize results into unified actionable feedback.

## Core Patterns

### Prompt Engineering

Effective prompts are the foundation of quality AI code review.

**Key Techniques**:
- **Role Prompting**: Assign explicit role and expertise level
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide good/bad examples with explanations
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Request step-by-step reasoning
- **Self-Consistency**: Run multiple reviews, report consensus

**When to Fine-Tune**: High volume reviews, consistent codebase, sufficient training data (hundreds of PRs).

**When to Use Prompts**: Limited data, diverse codebases, rapid evolution, prototyping.

See [patterns/code-review/prompt-engineering.md](../patterns/code-review/prompt-engineering.md) for complete prompt patterns and examples.

### Multi-Dimensional Parallel Review

Run specialized agents in parallel, each focusing on one dimension, then synthesize.

**Review Dimensions**:
1. **Security**: OWASP Top 10, auth/authz, input validation, secrets
2. **Performance**: Algorithmic complexity, memory, database queries, caching
3. **Maintainability**: Code complexity, DRY, SOLID, naming, organization
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav (UI code)
5. **Style & Standards**: Linting, formatting, type safety, documentation
6. **Test Coverage**: Tests present, edge cases, test quality

**Benefits**: 5-6x faster than sequential, reduced iteration churn, comprehensive coverage.

**Pattern**: Fan-Out → Parallel Execution → Gather → Synthesis

See [patterns/code-review/parallel-review.md](../patterns/code-review/parallel-review.md) for implementation details.

### CI/CD Integration

Integrate AI code review directly into deployment pipelines.

**Capabilities**:
- Intelligent test selection (run only relevant tests)
- Autonomous quality gates (context-aware decisions)
- Business-driven deployment (consider revenue, customer impact)
- Self-healing workflows (generate → review → fix loop)

**Performance**: 78% deployment time reduction while improving quality.

**Tools**: TestSprite, Testim, Functionize, Applitools, Testsigma.

See [patterns/code-review/ci-cd-integration.md](../patterns/code-review/ci-cd-integration.md) for pipeline integration patterns.

## Quick Start

### For Simple Review

**Use zero-shot with context:**
```
"Review this code for [specific concern]. Focus on [priorities]."
```

### For Comprehensive Review

**Run parallel multi-dimensional review:**
1. Distribute code to 6 specialized agents (security, performance, etc.)
2. Run all agents in parallel
3. Synthesize results into unified report
4. Prioritize by severity

### For Production Integration

**Integrate into CI/CD:**
1. Configure intelligent test selection
2. Set up autonomous quality gates
3. Define business-driven deployment criteria
4. Monitor and iterate on thresholds

## Best Practices

**Treat LLM as Pair Programmer**:
- Provide clear instructions and sufficient context
- Validate recommendations, don't blindly accept
- Maintain human oversight

**Define Clear Criteria**:
- What issues to look for
- Acceptable/unacceptable patterns
- Risk tolerance
- Priority order (security > performance > style)

**Validate Quality**:
- Spot-check AI reviews vs human reviews (10% sample)
- Track false positives and negatives
- Refine prompts based on errors
- Fine-tune models when data available

**Parallelize**:
- Run independent reviews simultaneously
- Minimize iteration churn
- Faster feedback to developers

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Quick PR review | Zero-shot with clear context + constraints |
| Comprehensive quality check | Multi-dimensional parallel review (all 6 dimensions) |
| Security-focused | Role prompting + security-specific checklist |
| Consistency check | Comparison pattern (reference existing code) |
| Migration review | Historical context pattern (compare to v1) |
| Production pipeline | Full CI/CD integration with intelligent selection |

## AI-on-AI Review

**Emerging practice**: One AI model reviews code generated by another.

**Approaches**:
- Different models (GPT-4 generates, Claude reviews)
- Different contexts (optimistic generator, critical reviewer)
- Multi-pass (security pass, performance pass, maintainability pass)

**Benefit**: Catches issues one model missed, reduces confirmation bias.
